# ray-trace-rest-of-your-life

This repo is my Python implemenetation of this project. I followed the book, translating into python as I went along, with some help from GitHub Copilot and a whole lot of digging into the Pyhon Docs. I have learned a lot about Ray Tracers and a lot about Python along the way.:

Next - Code is slow. I will optimize this code for PYthon. After that, I will try to implement with a compute shader using WebGPU (in a separate repo).
